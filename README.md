## Screenshot & Camshot 

When taking a screenshot or camshot from the victim's machine the image is stored on the server in the following format: \
Screenshot: (victim_ip)_screenshot_img_imageId.extention(jpg) \
Camshot: (victim_ip)_camshot_img_imageId.extention(jpg) \
image ID will auto increment for every image captured
